## 3d Printed handle for car's hood
For the last few days I have been making a handle for car hood. Made in FreeCAD with the idea to fix a broken one.

Making for around 5 hours and making around 3-4 prints for around average of 90 minutes each.

The print is made from PLA and has good enought mechanical strength when pulling, but the material doesn't have any protection from the elements so probably will soon wither.


## Protable server
The idea of printing a Raspberry Pi case upgrade for argon V2 (because this is what I have), for 2.5 or nvme ssd and small oled display for IP, heat and other important info. Similar ideas can be found on Thingiverse.
