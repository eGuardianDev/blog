# Week 13 - 2025

## Research
### ESP32 and home automation - 29.03
To connect to esp32 to automate your home you need to emulate other devices and this limits some functionality. Based on [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/SmartThings/comments/1ailn3g/support_for_esp32/) posts and [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PoUWszwaFk). You will need to develop custo mdriver


### Flipper zero and RFID protocols
Wanted to know more about nfc and found this post about [flipper zero](https://blog.flipper.net/rfid/amp/). From my simple testing there are too many protocols and encryptions to simply clone a card with your phone, so you need a special writer/reader and more indept knowledge about the encryptions.

### Making water pump filling machine
Wanted to make automatic water bottle/cup filler. The problem is how are you gonna stop the pump. Maybe [weight sensor](https://www.electronicevolution.bg/bg-product-details-75.html), but then you have to insert size of cup, or other sensor for light or radar than can detect liquid. Based on this [paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/336440730_Water_Level_Detection_System_Based_on_Ultrasonic_Sensors_HC-SR04_and_ESP8266-12_Modules_with_Telegram_and_Buzzer_Communication_Media) the [HC-SR04](https://erelement.com/shop/hc-sr04/) should work.

## other ideas:
- Sync alarm clock with automation devices and other IoT product - maybe the phone interface and close source nature won't allow it. There is something about [google clock and watch](https://www.reddit.com/r/PixelWatch/comments/17exq7a/alarm_sync_finally/), but uses google's app.
- I was thinking about how to use TOF sensors for keystone calibration of projectors. The math probably is not that complex, but there are problems of intersecting the signal and changing it, then sending it back to the projector. Found this [paper](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/19/12/2652) for the topic.
- Using website to share gyroscope data of phone, but for now unsuccessful attempts.
