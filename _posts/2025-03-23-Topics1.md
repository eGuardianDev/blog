# Week 12 - 2025

## Side project ideas
### [IoT project](https://github.com/eGuardianDev/SmartClock/tree/main) - 19.03 
For the IoT course project I was considering making an smart watch, but the scope of the project is too big. I was thinking about docking mode, which will make it work as the Iphone in StandBy mode inspired by [Scott Yu-Jan & OVERWERK](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3nWw8qSYgk). This directed me toward a small alarm clock with alarm for the side of bed, that can be controlled by PC, will track sleep/noise levels and enviroment variables. Maybe using E-Ink or 7-segment display.

## Interesting resources
- ~18.03 how to read a paper [aasthakm/courses](https://aasthakm.github.io/courses/howto-read-paper.pdf)
- 23.03 I was interested in fluid dynamics for a moment [FMI Plovdiv](http://web.uni-plovdiv.bg/marudova/Mechanics/mehanika_fluidi.pdf) (Maybe, because I was avoiding my actual work). I put this links here, because they will be useful if someday I want to read them [Marudova/Mechanics](http://web.uni-plovdiv.bg/marudova/Mechanics/)
